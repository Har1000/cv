        <strong>Guitar</strong>
        <p>My hobbies are playing Guitar and working out. Along with this, i also like cooking and most often i prepare a tea for myself.
Playing a guitar makes me feel stress relief and express my emotions by jamming alone. Also, i spent my 5 - 10 minutes working out daily.
